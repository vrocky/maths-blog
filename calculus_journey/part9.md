# Building Calculus from First Principles

## Article IX: Integration by Parts – An Alternative, Pattern-Based Approach

### Preface

In our series Building Calculus from First Principles, we have built the foundations of calculus by focusing on algebraic patterns and finite differences. In this article, we present an alternative proof of the integration by parts formula. Instead of relying solely on the standard proof via the product rule and the fundamental theorem of calculus, we express the functions as power series in the infinitesimal increment and then rearrange the resulting sums. This approach highlights the telescoping nature of the sums and makes the pattern behind the integration by parts formula transparent.

## 1. The Standard Integration by Parts Formula

Before we dive into the alternative proof, recall the familiar integration by parts formula:


$$
\int u\, dv = uv - \int v\, du.
$$

This formula is traditionally derived from the product rule for differentiation:


$$
(uv)' = u\,dv + v\,du.
$$

Integrating both sides over an interval $[a, b]$ and applying the fundamental theorem of calculus yields:


$$
\int_{a}^{b} u\,dv + \int_{a}^{b} v\,du = [uv]_{a}^{b},
$$

which can be rearranged to give:


$$
\int_{a}^{b} u\,dv = uv\Big|_{a}^{b} - \int_{a}^{b} v\,du.
$$

Taking limits (if needed) leads to the general formula. Our goal now is to provide an alternative, pattern-based derivation.

## 2. Alternative Proof: Expressing Functions as Series

### 2.1 Expanding the Functions

Assume that we can expand a function $f(x)$ and another function $G(x)$ (with derivative $g(x) = G'(x)$) in a power series about a point $x$. Write:


$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x + \Delta x) &= A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots + A_{n+1}\,(\Delta x)^n, \\
G(x + \Delta x) &= B_0 + B_1\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + B_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots + B_{n+1}\,(\Delta x)^n.
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $f(x)$ and $G(x)$ are the values at $x$, we have:


$$
A_0 = f(x) \quad \text{and} \quad B_0 = G(x).
$$

Moreover, because the derivative of $G$ is $g$, we have by definition:


$$
G(x + \Delta x) = G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x + \text{(higher order terms)}.
$$

Thus, we can write:


$$
G(x + \Delta x) = G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + B_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots.
$$

### 2.2 Forming the Product and Its Difference

Consider the product $f(x) \, G(x)$ and how its change over an increment $\Delta x$ relates to the individual expansions. Our ultimate goal is to see how the differences lead to a telescoping pattern that recovers the integration by parts formula.

One way to approach this is to consider the difference of the product over the increment $\Delta x$:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \bigl[f(x) G(x)\bigr] &= f(x + \Delta x) \, G(x + \Delta x) - f(x)\, G(x).
\end{aligned}
$$

Using our series expansions, we would obtain a long expression that contains terms of different orders in $\Delta x$. Our aim is to isolate the linear terms (i.e. terms proportional to $\Delta x$), because in the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$, the higher order terms vanish.

For clarity, let’s denote by $f_{A_1}(x) = A_1$ and similarly for $G$ that $B_1 = g(x)$. Then, to first order in $\Delta x$:


$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x + \Delta x) &\approx f(x) + f_{A_1}(x)\,\Delta x,\\[1mm]
G(x + \Delta x) &\approx G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x.
\end{aligned}
$$

Multiplying these approximations, we have:


$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x + \Delta x)\,G(x + \Delta x) &\approx \Bigl[f(x) + f_{A_1}(x)\,\Delta x\Bigr] \Bigl[G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x\Bigr] \\
&= f(x)G(x) + \Bigl[f(x)g(x) + G(x)f_{A_1}(x)\Bigr]\Delta x + \text{(higher order terms)}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the increment in the product is:


$$
f(x + \Delta x)G(x + \Delta x) - f(x)G(x) \approx \Bigl[f(x)g(x) + G(x)f_{A_1}(x)\Bigr]\Delta x.
$$

Now, if we consider the standard integration by parts formula, the expression we expect to see is of the form:


$$
\int f(x) \, g(x) \, dx = f(x) G(x) - \int G(x) \, f_{A_1}(x) \, dx.
$$

Our expansion above gives us one piece, and the remainder must come from a careful reorganization of the summation. In our alternative proof approach, we write the integral as a limit of a sum and then group differences in a telescopic manner.

### 2.3 Rewriting the Integral as a Sum

Recall that by definition, the integral is given by:


$$
\int_{0}^{N} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} f(i \cdot \Delta x) \, \Delta x.
$$

If we apply this idea to the product $f(x)g(x)$ (or equivalently $f(x) G'(x)$), we write:


$$
\int f(x) \, g(x) \, dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} f(i\Delta x) \, g(i\Delta x) \, \Delta x.
$$

One alternative strategy is to note that we can write the sum as a telescoping sum if we express $f$ in terms of its differences:


$$
f(i\Delta x) = \bigl[f(i\Delta x) - f((i-1)\Delta x)\bigr] + f((i-1)\Delta x).
$$

While the full expansion can become complex, the key idea is that if you express the differences as series (as we did earlier for the antiderivative) and then rearrange terms, you can identify groups that cancel telescopically. The surviving terms will involve $f$ and $G$ evaluated at the endpoints, yielding:


$$
\int f(x) \, g(x) \, dx = f(x) G(x) - \int G(x) \, f'(x) \, dx.
$$

This is the pattern-based alternative derivation of the integration by parts formula.

## 3. A Step-by-Step Outline of the Alternative Proof

Let’s summarize the process with more detailed intermediate steps:

1. Expand $f(x+\Delta x)$ and $G(x+\Delta x)$ in a Series:


$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x + \Delta x) &= A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + A_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots + A_{n+1}\,(\Delta x)^n,\\[1mm]
G(x + \Delta x) &= B_0 + B_1\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + B_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots + B_{n+1}\,(\Delta x)^n.
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $A_0 = f(x)$ and $B_0 = G(x)$. Moreover, $B_1 = g(x)$.


2. Express $G(x+\Delta x)$ in Terms of $G(x)$ and $g(x)$:


$$
G(x + \Delta x) = G(x) + g(x)\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + B_3\,(\Delta x)^3 + \cdots.
$$


3. Form the Product $f(x+\Delta x) G(x+\Delta x)$:

Multiply the series:


$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x+\Delta x)G(x+\Delta x) &= \Bigl[A_0 + A_1\,\Delta x + A_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots\Bigr] \\
&\quad \times \Bigl[B_0 + B_1\,\Delta x + B_2\,(\Delta x)^2 + \cdots\Bigr].
\end{aligned}
$$


4. Identify the Linear (First-Order) Term:

The constant term is $A_0 B_0 = f(x) G(x)$. The first-order term in $\Delta x$ is:


$$
A_0 B_1\,\Delta x + A_1 B_0\,\Delta x,
$$

which equals


$$
f(x) \, g(x) \, \Delta x + G(x) \, f'(x) \, \Delta x.
$$


5. Relate the Sum of the Differences to the Integral:

When you sum the differences over a partition and take the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$, the higher-order terms vanish. The telescoping sum will then yield:


$$
\sum_{i=0}^{N/\Delta x} \Bigl[f(x_{i+1})G(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)G(x_i)\Bigr] = f(N)G(N) - f(0)G(0).
$$

However, reorganizing the terms by grouping the differences for $f$ and $G$ separately leads to the rearranged form:


$$
\int f(x)\,g(x)\,dx = f(x)G(x) - \int G(x)\,f'(x)\,dx.
$$


6. Conclusion:

This manipulation shows that the incremental changes in the product $f(x)G(x)$ can be expressed as a telescoping series. In the limit, the sum of these differences equals the difference at the endpoints, thus yielding the integration by parts formula:


$$
\boxed{\int u\, dv = uv - \int v\, du.}
$$



## 4. Final Remarks

This alternative proof, which is based on expanding the increments as power series and reorganizing the sum, reveals the hidden algebraic pattern behind integration by parts. Instead of simply applying the product rule, we see that every term in the expansion contributes to a telescoping sum that naturally cancels out the intermediate contributions, leaving only the endpoint evaluations and a residual term that corresponds to the second integral.

This method is particularly powerful because:

- It makes all the intermediate steps and patterns visible.
- It emphasizes that integration is the summation of infinitesimal changes.
- It provides an intuitive, first-principles foundation for the integration by parts formula.
