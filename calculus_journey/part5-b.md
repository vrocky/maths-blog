# Building Calculus from First Principles

## Part V-2: Properties with Division Involved

### Preface

In Part V-1, we derived the generalized expansion for functions of the form


$$
\frac{1}{ax+by} = \frac{1}{by} - \frac{ax}{b^2y^2} + \frac{a^2x^2}{b^3y^3} - \frac{a^3x^3}{b^4y^4} + \cdots,
$$

which was obtained using elementary algebra, long division, and the geometric series expansion. In this installment, we use similar elementary, algebraic methods to derive several differentiation formulas that involve division. By examining the power series and “peeling off” the coefficients (i.e. matching the terms in the series), we will derive formulas for the derivatives of functions such as $\sec(x)$, $\csc(x)$, $\tan(x)$, and $\log(x)$. Our focus is on the visible algebraic patterns without invoking geometric notions.

## 1. Derivative of $\sec(x)$

### Statement


$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \sec(x) \tan(x).
$$

### Proof

We start with:


$$
\begin{align*}
\sec(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\cos(x + h)} \\
\because \cos(x + h) &= \cos(x)\cos(h) - \sin(x)\sin(h) \\
\therefore\quad \sec(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\cos(x)\cos(h) - \sin(x)\sin(h)} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x)\, h} \quad \text{(for small } h\text{)}.
\end{align*}
$$

We then expand $\frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x) h}$ as a series in $h$. Observing the pattern, one can see that this series has a ratio of


$$
\frac{-\sin(x)h}{\cos(x)},
$$

so that the linear (first-order) term in $h$ is:


$$
\frac{-\sin(x)h}{\cos^2(x)}.
$$

Thus, by our pattern-based approach, the derivative is determined by this coefficient, and we obtain:


$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \sec(x) \tan(x).}
$$

## 2. Chain Rule Example Using Division

### Setup

Let


$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= \frac{1}{x}, \\
g(x) &= \cos(x).
\end{aligned}
$$

We wish to find the expansion of the composite function $f(g(x+h))$.

### Proof Idea

Consider the expansion for $\sec(x+h)$ (which is $1/\cos(x+h)$) again:


$$
\begin{align*}
\sec(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\cos(x + h)} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x) h} \quad \text{(for small } h\text{)}.
\end{align*}
$$

When we expand $f(g(x+h))$, the idea is that the incremental change in the composite function can be interpreted as the product of the incremental change of the inner function $g(x)$ and the derivative of the outer function $f$ evaluated at $g(x)$. In other words, the first-order term in the expansion of $f(g(x+h))$ is:


$$
f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \, h.
$$

This is exactly the chain rule:


$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).}
$$

## 3. Derivative of $\csc(x)$

### Statement


$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\csc(x)] = -\csc(x) \cot(x).
$$

### Proof

We start with:


$$
\begin{align*}
\csc(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\sin(x + h)} \\
\because \sin(x + h) &= \sin(x)\cos(h) + \cos(x)\sin(h) \\
\therefore\quad \csc(x + h) &= \frac{1}{\sin(x)\cos(h) + \cos(x)\sin(h)} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{\sin(x) + \cos(x)h} \quad \text{(for small } h\text{)}.
\end{align*}
$$

Here, the expansion of $\frac{1}{\sin(x) + \cos(x)h}$ reveals that the ratio of the linear term in $h$ is approximately:


$$
\frac{-\cos(x)h}{\sin^2(x)}.
$$

Thus, the coefficient of $h$ in the expansion (which determines the derivative) leads to:


$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\csc(x)] = -\csc(x) \cot(x).}
$$

## 4. Derivative of $\tan(x)$

### Statement


$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x).
$$

### Proof

We have:


$$
\begin{align*}
\tan(x+h) &= \frac{\sin(x+h)}{\cos(x+h)}.
\end{align*}
$$

Using the approximations for small $h$:


$$
\begin{aligned}
\sin(x+h) &\approx \sin(x) + \cos(x)h,\\[1mm]
\cos(x+h) &\approx \cos(x) - \sin(x)h,
\end{aligned}
$$

we write:


$$
\tan(x+h) \approx \frac{\sin(x) + \cos(x)h}{\cos(x) - \sin(x)h}.
$$

This can be expressed as:


$$
\tan(x+h) = [\sin(x) + \cos(x)h] \cdot \frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x)h}.
$$

Now, expand the reciprocal:


$$
\frac{1}{\cos(x) - \sin(x)h} = C_0 + C_1 h + \ldots,
$$

where we define:


$$
\begin{aligned}
C_0 &= \frac{1}{\cos(x)}, \\[1mm]
C_1 &= \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Multiplying out, the constant term of the product gives $\sin(x)C_0$ and the first-order term in $h$ will involve:


$$
C_0 \cos(x) + C_1 \sin(x).
$$

Substitute the values:


$$
C_0 \cos(x) + C_1 \sin(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{\cos(x)} + \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)} \sin(x) = 1 + \frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}.
$$

Recognize that:


$$
1 + \tan^2(x) = \sec^2(x).
$$

Thus,


$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x).}
$$

## 5. Derivative of $\log(x)$

### Statement


$$
\frac{d}{dx}[\log(x)] = \frac{1}{x}.
$$

### Proof

We expand $\log(x+h)$ as follows:


$$
\begin{align*}
\log(x + h) &= \log\Bigl(x\Bigl(1 + \frac{h}{x}\Bigr)\Bigr) \\
&= \log(x) + \log\Bigl(1 + \frac{h}{x}\Bigr) \\
&\approx \log(x) + \frac{h}{x},
\end{align*}
$$

where we have used the elementary approximation:


$$
\log(1+\varepsilon) \approx \varepsilon \quad \text{for small } \varepsilon.
$$

Thus, the coefficient of $h$ is $\frac{1}{x}$, which implies:


$$
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\log(x)] = \frac{1}{x}.}
$$

## 6. Conclusion

In this article, we have extended our first-principles, pattern-based approach to derive several differentiation formulas for functions involving division. By examining the series expansions—using elementary methods such as long division and geometric series—we obtained:

- $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\,x^{-1} = -x^{-2}$.
- $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\sec(x)] = \sec(x)\tan(x)$.
- $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\csc(x)] = -\csc(x)\cot(x)$.
- $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x)$.
- $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[\log(x)] = \frac{1}{x}$.

Each result is reached by identifying the coefficient of the first-order term in the series expansion of the function when its argument is incremented by a small $h$. This approach reinforces that the standard differentiation formulas are natural consequences of the algebraic structure of power series.

## 7. Final Remarks

This article has illustrated the power and elegance of an algebraic, pattern-based approach to calculus. By relying solely on elementary techniques, we have demonstrated that many familiar rules of differentiation emerge naturally from series expansions. This method not only provides a rigorous entry point to calculus from first principles but also offers a unified and intuitive way to view the underlying structure of mathematical functions.
